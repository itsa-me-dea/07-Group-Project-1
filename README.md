# Find Your Muse | Music Selection App
### **[Description](#description) | [Usage](#usage) | [Credits](#credits)**

## Description

- We wanted to spice up our music tastes and have someone else pick for once what we listen to.
- We build this website to solve that problem by choosing random songs based on a genre of music
- This solves the problem of choice
- When the songs populate they come out blurry to hide their identities so it's harder to reconize the songs before you click on them.
- We learned inegrating two API's with little to no knowledge is alot harder then thought. 

## Usage
Using this site is pretty straight forward at this time. You choose a genre of music and then the program will create a search to spotify where it will find some songs in that genre and will populate the titles for you. Click on a title that looks intresting and the album image will populate. Click on the spotify logo or youtube logo to listen to the song!
